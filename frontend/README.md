This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Map Feature

The interactive map feature uses **Leaflet with OpenStreetMap** - **no API key required!**

- ✅ 100% free
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No usage limits

See [LEAFLET_SETUP.md](./LEAFLET_SETUP.md) for more details.

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Pipeline Validation with Makefile

### Frontend Pipeline Checks

The frontend includes a Makefile to run all CI/CD pipeline checks locally before creating a PR. This ensures your code will pass the GitHub Actions pipeline.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all frontend pipeline checks (recommended before PR)
make check

# Quick check without tests (faster for development)
make check-quick

# Get help with all available commands
make help
```

#### Available Frontend Commands

```bash
# Main pipeline commands
make check          # Run all checks: lint, format, test, build
make check-quick    # Quick version: lint, format, build (no tests)

# Individual checks
make lint           # Run ESLint checks
make format         # Check Prettier formatting
make test           # Run unit and E2E tests (if available)
make build          # Create production build

# Setup and maintenance
make install        # Install dependencies with frozen lockfile
make clean          # Clean node_modules and build artifacts
make setup          # Initial development environment setup
```

#### Pipeline Workflow

The Makefile mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`:

1. **Linting & Formatting** - ESLint and Prettier checks
2. **Testing** - Unit tests (Jest) and E2E tests (Cypress) if installed
3. **Build** - Production build verification

    ### Backend Pipeline Checks

    The backend also includes a comprehensive Makefile for CI/CD validation.

    #### Backend Quick Start

    ```bash
    cd ../backend

    # Run full CI pipeline (matches GitHub Actions)
    make ci

    # Run all backend workflows (CI + security)
    make all

    # Get help with all available commands
    make help
    ```

    #### Key Backend Commands

    ```bash
    # Main pipeline commands
    make ci              # Full CI pipeline: install, format-check, lint, typecheck, test-cov, build
    make security-ci     # Security pipeline: install, security-lint, security-test, build
    make all             # Run all CI/CD pipelines

    # Individual checks
    make lint            # Run ESLint
    make format-check    # Check Prettier formatting
    make typecheck       # TypeScript type checking
    make test            # Run unit tests
    make test-cov        # Run tests with coverage
    make test-e2e        # Run E2E tests (requires PostgreSQL)
    make build           # Build the application

    # Pre-commit workflow
    make pre-commit      # Run format-check, lint, typecheck, test
    ```

    ### Before Creating a PR

    Run these commands to ensure your PR will pass all pipeline checks:

    ```bash
    # Frontend checks
    cd frontend
    make check

    The makefile is designed to replicate the exact same checks that run in GitHub Actions, giving you confidence that your PR will pass the CI/CD pipeline.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
